            <h2><strong>Professor Helen Gleeson</strong> </h2>
            
            <p>I  am currently Head of School of Physics and Astronomy at Leeds and am very involved in activities that promote the uptake of science and engineering by women and other minorities. I work within my institution and nationally in this area and was awarded my OBE for these activities in 2009. My research concerns self-ordering and self-assembling materials, particularly liquid crystal phases. I'm an experimentalist and use a variety of approaches to understand liquid crystal structures. An important part of my research is to understand how liquid crystals can be used for non-display applications, leading to the invention of switchable contact lenses in which the voltage-induced change in refractive index of the liquid crystal lens element causes a change in focus, equivalent to putting on reading glasses. </p>

            <p> I am currently Senior Scientist at GAM Systematic | Cantab
              <br>
              I studied Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge, and completed a PhD in Cosmology in 2011. My research was concerned with the problem of dark energy, looking for astrophysical signatures left by "new" particles within modified theories of gravity.
              <br>
              I joined Cantab, a fully systematic quantitative hedge fund based in Cambridge U.K., straight after completing my PhD. I am part of the quant team dedicated to designing trading strategies and managing risk.</p>

            <h2><strong>Dr Emma Bradshaw</strong> </h2>
            <p>I'm currently the social media executive for BBC One, having previously managed the social media and built the websites for the British Royal Family, BBC Two and BBC Stargazing. For my undergraduate degree I did a Masters in Physics with Astronomy at the University of Nottingham. I also studied for my PhD (and 1.5 years post-doc) at Nottingham under Prof. Omar Almaini on AGN at redshifts 1-1.5. Although I don't directly use my PhD any more, my studies were integral to me getting my job at the BBC, and also helps with the millions and millions of pieces of statistics that my team processes every week. My favourite galaxy is the penguin galaxy.
