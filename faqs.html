    <p class="description">This page hopes to answer any questions you might have about the confererence, how to register, and whether it is for you.</p>
    
    <h3>How do I register for the event?</h3>
    <p>Registration is through eventbrite. The link can be found on the registration page.</p>
    
    <h3>I did my undergrad in Physics but am doing a PhD in another discipline, can I still come to the conference?</h3>
    <p>Of course! This conference hopes to give PhD students an idea of the wide range of careers possible after a PhD, which will be relevant for anyone with a background in Physics.</p>
    
    <h3>I did my undergrad in another discipline but am doing a PhD in Physics, will the conference be too physics based for me?</h3>
    <p>No, the conference is going to be mainly focussed on the experience of Physics PhD graduates, the speakers may discuss their science but they won't be going into too much detail on their science!</p>
    

    <h3>Is there any funding available for travel?</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately we can't provide any assistance for travel to the conference, however most PhD students should be able to claim this from their travel fund provided as part of their studentship.</p>
    
    <h3>What will the talks be about?</h3>
    <p>We are asking all the speakers to discuss what their research/job is now, what their career paths have been, how and when they decided to follow that path, and how they use their PhD in their day-to-day at work. We've also asked them to cover some topics specific to their experiences.</p>
