    <p class="description">This page hopes to answer any questions you might have about the confererence, how to register, and whether it is for you.</p>
    
    <h3>Where do I go to register on the day?</h3>
    <p>Registration will be in B14 in the Engineering and Science Learning Centre. Registration opens at 9:30 and there will also be tea and coffee available at this time</p>
    
    <h3>How do I get to the conference location?</h3>
    <p>University Park is most easily accessible by the tram from Nottingham Station. Please see our <a href="./location">Location and Travel</a> page for more details, and a campus map showing where registration and the talks are.</p>
    
    <h3>Is parking available at the conference?</h3>
    <p>We do not have dedicated parking for the conference. There is a visitors car park on campus that costs ~Â£10 for the day, however we strongly recommend travelling by public transport if you are able.</p>
    

    <h3>Is there any funding available for travel?</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately we can't provide any assistance for travel to the conference, however most PhD students should be able to claim this from their travel fund provided as part of their studentship.</p>
    
    <h3>What will the talks be about?</h3>
    <p>We are asking all the speakers to discuss what their research/job is now, what their career paths have been, how and when they decided to follow that path, and how they use their PhD in their day-to-day at work. We've also asked them to cover some topics specific to their experiences.</p>
