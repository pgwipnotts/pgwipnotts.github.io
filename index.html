  <p class="description">The Postgraduate Women in Physics Conference will be a one day conference all about the careers of Women in Physics after a PhD. The aim of the day is to inspire fellow students and highlight potential avenues for a career post-PhD. We are are hoping to have 5-6 speakers from both academia and industry at the event to talk about their career paths and their experiences of being a woman in physics. It should be a great way for lots of students to come together, network, and find out about what is possible after completing a PhD in physics.</p>
